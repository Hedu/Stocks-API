# Stock rest API

This project uses maven and is based on spring boot, so the easiest way of running it is to execute:

``mvn clean spring-boot:run``

The project also makes use of swagger, so the documentation of the API, as well as a way to test it can be found in http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html?url=/v3/api-docs (after having started the server)

Some test have been created, in order to execute them, run:

``mvn clean test``

A basic frontend project has been created. It can be run by moving to the my-app folder and execute:

``npm install``

``npm start``
